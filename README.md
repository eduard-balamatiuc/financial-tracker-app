# Financial Tracker App

## Introduction

Welcome to the Financial Tracker App project! This application is the result of our third-semester class, "The Basics of Application Development." Our goal is to create a comprehensive financial tracking system that addresses the common challenges people face in managing their expenses and income.

## Problem Statement

**Problem:** The problem we aim to address is the absence of an efficient and comprehensive expense and income tracking system. Many individuals struggle with managing their finances, which often leads to suboptimal economic decisions.

**Impact:** Inadequate financial management can have a significant impact on individuals' financial stability and overall quality of life. It can result in indebtedness, stress, and missed opportunities for savings and investments.

**Existing Solutions:** While there are existing expense tracking applications available, they often lack critical features such as automatic check scanning, and some functionalities may come with associated costs. Examples of such applications include Wallet, Monefy, and Money Lover.

## Project Scope

Our project will encompass the following components:

- **Front End:** The user interface of the application, where users can input their financial data, view summaries, and access various features.

- **Back End:** The core logic and functionality of the application, responsible for processing user data and managing the database.

- **Database Communication:** Interaction with a database to store and retrieve financial data securely.

- **API Communication:** Integration with external APIs for features like currency conversion, stock market data, etc. (if applicable).

- **Check Scanning and Data Extraction:** A feature to scan and extract data from paychecks, allowing automatic input of income information into the app.

- **Dockerization:** Containerization of the application to ensure it can be easily deployed in various environments.

- **Code Validation with Tox:** We use Tox for code validation to ensure code quality, consistency, and testing across different Python environments.

## Ideal Outcome

At the end of this project, we aim to achieve the following:

- Develop a user-friendly application that effortlessly tracks expenses, scans documents, checks, and income.

- Empower users to make well-informed financial decisions by providing insights and summaries of their financial data.

- Enhance users' financial well-being by promoting responsible financial management.

- Simplify income tracking by enabling users to scan and extract data from their paychecks.

- Maintain high code quality through automated testing and validation with Tox.
